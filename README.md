## 🚀 Quick Start <span id="quick-start"></span>

Get up and running in under 5 minutes!

### 1️⃣ Configuration

Create a configuration file `config/default.toml`:

```toml
# config/default.toml
[database]
url = "postgresql://user:password@localhost/crawlrs"
max_connections = 20

[redis]
url = "redis://localhost:6379"

[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8899

[rate_limiting]
enabled = true
default_rpm = 60
default_concurrent = 10

[cache]
enabled = true
default_ttl = 300

[search]
default_engine = "baidu"
[search.engines]
google_enabled = true
bing_enabled = true
baidu_enabled = true
sogou_enabled = true
```

### 2️⃣ Database Setup

```bash
# Run migrations using built-in CLI
cargo run --bin crawlrs -- migrate

# Or with SQLx CLI
sqlx database create
sqlx migrate run
```

### 3️⃣ Run Server

```bash
# Development mode with hot reloading
cargo run --bin crawlrs

# Production mode
./target/release/crawlrs
```

### 4️⃣ Verify Installation

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8899/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"healthy"}
```

> **Complete API Reference:** [API_REFERENCE.md](docs/API_REFERENCE.md) | **User Guide:** [USER_GUIDE.md](docs/USER_GUIDE.md)

### 🔑 Authentication

All protected endpoints require an API key in `Authorization` header:

```bash
# Format
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

# Example curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer crawlrs_sk_abc123" \
  http://localhost:8899/v1/scrape
```

> **⚠️ Security Tip:** Never commit API keys to version control. Use environment variables.
